Created a responsive Website for Pizza ordering system using Java Script , Html, CSS.

index.html:-

This is an HTML file that creates a website for a pizza restaurant called Vedant Pizza. It uses Bootstrap CSS framework for styling and has a navbar with links to
 the Home page, Menu page, About Us page, and Contact Us page. It also includes a logo of the restaurant and Social media links. The HTML file also includes several links 
and images, which are used to navigate through the pages and provide visual elements to the website. It also uses font-awesome for icons and OwlCarousel for carousel feature
 and it also includes a custom font from google fonts.

 The CSS file is imported from the link assets/css/style.css which is likely to be used for styling the website.

script.js:-

This is a JavaScript code snippet that uses the jQuery library to create an Owl Carousel on the element with the class "owl-carousel"
 within an element with the id "banner-slider". The code selects the element and creates a carousel with the following options:

items: 1, which sets the number of items to display in the carousel at once
loop: true, which loops the carousel indefinitely
autoplay: true, which automatically plays the carousel
nav: true, which enables navigation controls for the carousel, allowing the user to manually navigate through the items.
When the page is loaded and the DOM is ready, this code will run and create the carousel on the designated element.
